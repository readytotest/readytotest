# Welcome to My QA Lab! ü•ºüß™üî¨

## About Me üë§

I'm an **exploratory tester** with a background in **UX research** and **usability testing**. Stacked on top of that is **test automation** and **CI/CD**. I don't assume something works just because it looks like it does. **I pick it up, shake it, and see what falls out**. I support the team by spotting problems before they become bigger headaches.

 And I like **sharing knowledge** and **helping others learn** things.

## The Story Behind All This üìñ

It started with JavaScript tutorials to learn test automation and turned into a full-lifecycle project, complete with a hand-coded [1990s-style personal homepage](https://readytotest.github.io). Things evolved as I went. Learned a lot through trial and error, getting hands-on, and picking up smarter, cleaner ways to do things from the devs I've worked with.

My repos revolve around ![Playwright](./img/playwright.png)**Playwright/TypeScript**, but I have some older projects in ![Cypress](./img/cypress.png)**Cypress/JavaScript** too.

## Automated Testing on Every Pull Request
Every PR or change to my website [triggers automated tests](https://github.com/readytotest/readytotest.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/playwright-mysite.yml) and publishes an [Allure report](https://readytotest.github.io/playwright-allure-report/) to a GitHub Pages site. I also created the [The Repo Clean-O-Matic](https://github.com/readytotest/playwright-allure-report/blob/main/.github/workflows/repo-clean-o-matic.yml) to keep the report repo size under control.

## Snippets from My QA Philosophy ‚úÇÔ∏è
### Don't just make sure nothing's on fire, ask why the gas line's leaking. üí• 

QA isn't just about green checkmarks. It's about figuring out what's hiding behind them. It's digging up hidden risks, questioning specs when they feel off, and finding what no one thought to ask before users do.

Instead of saying, "Here's a bug, this doesn't work." I ask, "How might users react? How could this affect the company?"

Quality kicks in way before code shows up. Upstream affects downstream. Bugs don't only originate in the code. They also come from rushed choices, [fuzzy requirements](https://readytotest.github.io/html/requirement-gap.htm), and blind spots.

>‚ú® QA shouldn't only be the person who shows up after the party and says, "**Hey, someone spilled wine on the couch.**" üç∑ QA should be the one saying, "**Hey, maybe don't set the red wine next to the dance floor in the first place.**" 

My job is to provide insights so the team can make informed decisions.

Automation can't replace human intuition or creativity.
